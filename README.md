🧠 Auto Chat Responder Bot using OpenAI + PyAutoGUI
This Python script automates replying to Facebook Messenger messages using OpenAI's GPT model and simulates human-like interaction using pyautogui. It reads the latest message from a specific person, generates a smart response using OpenAI's chat model (gpt-4o), and sends the reply—all automatically.

🔧 Features

💬 Detects if the last message is from a specific person

🤖 Auto-copies chat content and responds instantly

🖱️ Uses pyautogui for GUI automation (mouse + keyboard)

📋 Uses pyperclip for clipboard operations

⚠️ Note
Make sure your screen resolution and coordinates match the ones in the script.

This script uses hard-coded screen coordinates for clicks and drags. You may need to adjust them based on your screen setup.

For safety, avoid pushing your real API key to GitHub. Use environment variables or .env files instead.
